# Specification: Network Identity and P2P Protocol

## Objective

Define RNG's network-layer identity: magic bytes, ports, address encoding, protocol version, peer discovery, and user agent. This spec ensures nodes correctly identify RNG peers and reject cross-chain connections.

## Evidence Status

### Verified Facts (grounded in source code)

- **Network magic bytes** (from `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`):
  - Mainnet: `0xB07C010E`
  - Testnet: `0xB07C7E57`
  - Testnet4: `0xB07C7434`
  - Regtest: `0xB07C0000`
- **Default ports**:
  - Mainnet P2P: `8433`
  - Mainnet RPC: `8432`
  - Testnet P2P: `18433`
  - Testnet RPC: `18432`
  - Testnet4 P2P: `48433`
  - Regtest P2P: `18544`
  - Regtest RPC: `18543`
- **Protocol version**: `70100` (distinct from Bitcoin Core's protocol versioning)
- **User agent**: `/RNG:3.0.0/` (from `CMakeLists.txt` version 3.0.0)
- **Address prefixes (mainnet)**:
  - P2PKH: byte `25` → base58 prefix `B`
  - P2SH: byte `5` → base58 prefix `A`
  - Bech32 HRP: `rng` (addresses: `rng1...`)
  - WIF: byte `128` → base58 prefix `5/K/L`
  - Extended public key: `bpub`
  - Extended private key: `bprv`
- **Address prefixes (testnet)**:
  - P2PKH: byte `111` → base58 prefix `t`
  - P2SH: byte `196` → base58 prefix `s`
  - Bech32 HRP: `trng` (addresses: `trng1...`)
  - WIF: byte `239` → base58 prefix `c`
  - Extended public key: `tpub`
  - Extended private key: `tprv`
- **DNS seeds** (from `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`):
  - `seed1.rng.network`
  - `seed2.rng.network`
  - `seed3.rng.network`
- **Hardcoded seed peers** (operator-seeded, from scripts and chainparams):
  - `95.111.239.142:8433`
  - `161.97.114.192:8433`
  - `185.218.126.23:8433`
  - `185.239.209.227:8433`
- **P2P message format**: Bitcoin-compatible (same serialization, same message types)
- **Data directory**: `~/.rng` (default, changed from Bitcoin's `~/.bitcoin`)
- **Config file**: `rng.conf` (in data directory)
- **Default RPC credentials** (from install scripts): user `agent`, password randomly generated (32-char hex)
- **RPC bind**: `127.0.0.1` by default (localhost only)

### Recommendations (intended system)

- Plan 005 proposes adding three new P2P message types for share relay: `shareinv`, `getshare`, `share` — these do not exist in the current codebase
- DNS seeds should resolve to operational nodes; if `seed{1,2,3}.rng.network` do not resolve, nodes fall back to hardcoded peers

### Hypotheses / Unresolved Questions

- Whether the DNS seeds (`seed{1,2,3}.rng.network`) are currently resolving to live nodes, or whether peer discovery relies entirely on hardcoded seed IPs
- Whether protocol version `70100` will need bumping when/if sharepool P2P messages are added

## Acceptance Criteria

- Nodes on mainnet use magic bytes `0xB07C010E` for all P2P messages
- Nodes on mainnet listen on port `8433` by default (P2P) and `8432` (RPC)
- Bech32 addresses on mainnet use HRP `rng` (e.g., `rng1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7k...`)
- Bech32 addresses on testnet use HRP `trng`
- P2PKH addresses on mainnet start with `B`
- The user agent string includes `/RNG:` followed by the version
- RPC is bound to `127.0.0.1` by default — not exposed to public network
- Nodes reject connections with mismatched magic bytes
- Data directory defaults to `~/.rng`, not `~/.bitcoin`
- Config file is named `rng.conf`, not `bitcoin.conf`

## Verification

```bash
# Verify network identity from a running node
rng-cli getnetworkinfo | jq '{version, subversion, protocolversion, localaddresses}'
# Expected: subversion "/RNG:3.0.0/", protocolversion 70100

# Verify mainnet genesis (confirms correct chain)
rng-cli getblockhash 0
# Expected: 83a6a482f85dc88c07387980067e9b61e5d8f61818aae9106b6bbc496d36ace4

# Verify peer connections use correct port
rng-cli getpeerinfo | jq '.[].addr'
# Addresses should show port 8433

# Verify bech32 address generation
rng-cli -rpcwallet=miner getnewaddress "" bech32
# Should return rng1... address

# Verify data directory
ls ~/.rng/
# Should contain blocks/, chainstate/, rng.conf, etc.

# Verify RPC is localhost-only
rng-cli getnetworkinfo | jq '.localaddresses'
# RPC should not be publicly exposed
```

## Open Questions

1. Are the DNS seeds (`seed{1,2,3}.rng.network`) currently operational? If not, should they be removed or replaced with working entries?
2. Should the hardcoded seed peer list be expanded as the network grows? The current 4 IPs are all operator-run Contabo validators.
3. Is protocol version `70100` documented anywhere as a version policy? E.g., when should it be bumped?
4. Should RNG support Tor/I2P/CJDNS transports like upstream Bitcoin Core v29, or are those deprioritized?
